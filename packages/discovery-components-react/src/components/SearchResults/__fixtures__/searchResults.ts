      title: 'I Am So Incredibly Ready For NBA Tanking To Be A Thing Of The Past',
      text:
        'Nine NBA <em>teams</em> finished with fewer than 30 wins this regular season; 18 <em>teams</em> finished with winning records; just three NBA <em>teams</em> won between 30 and 41 games. The nickname for the positioning of <em>teams</em> like the Hornets and Pistons is the “treadmill of mediocrity,” but that’s not a fate to which <em>teams</em> in that middle range are doomed: of the 11 <em>teams</em> to finish in the 30-to-41-win range last season, five (Portland, Miami, Denver, New Orleans, Minnesota) blossomed into genuinely good playoff-caliber <em>teams</em> this season. The idea is to still give the worst <em>teams</em> first crack at franchise-altering draft talent, without providing such a strong incentive for not-good <em>teams</em> to throw away their seasons in pursuit of lottery gold. This season it had the effect of virtually wiping out an entire class of NBA <em>teams</em>. A consequence of that is a regular season that seems illegitimate, with 18 “winning” <em>teams</em> whose records were bloated with low-hanging fruit, and a group of bottom-feeders so deep that <em>teams</em> trying to lose couldn’t help but win. Part of the reason why so many <em>teams</em> finished better than .500 this season is because so many <em>teams</em> were throwing away games; part of the reason why all of the <em>teams</em> who finished with fewer than 30 wins won at least 21 games is the sheer number of double-tank games played in the season’s second half. The numbers are all screwed up.'
